# Summary

Finnish-OOD is an external out-of-domain test set for Finnish-TDT annotated natively into UD scheme.


# Introduction

The treebank contains texts from anonymized nursing narratives (hospital patient records), discussion forums, tweets, general web crawls and poetry collected from the Internet. Text sources are marked as sentence identifier prefixes (`# sent_id = identifier`), cl = nursing narratives, thread = discussion forums, tweet = tweets, web = web crawl, and poem = poetry. The document structure can also been resolved from the sentence identifiers.
